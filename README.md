# ExponentialFamily

``ExponentialFamily.jl`` is a package that collets exponential family distributions from ``Distributions.j`` and customized implementations of some while augmenting them with exponential family-specific functionalities. It defines analytic products of distributions belonging to the same exponential family that can be used for conjugate computations in inference algorithms.
